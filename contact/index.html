     <p id="abouttext">
      Hi, I am <span id= "aboutsub">Hanbee!</span>
      <br>
      I am a junior designer living in Bay Area. My creative journey is an odyssey spanning continents and cultures, culminating in a BA in <span id= "aboutsub">Graphic Design</span> with a minor in <span id= "aboutsub">Digital Media Art</span> from San Jose State University. 
      <br><br>
      However, my education extends beyond borders, having immersed myself in design studies across <span id= "aboutsub">South Korea, Thailand, Ireland, Belgium, and now the United States.</span>
      <br><br>
      As a communicative designer, my experiences living among diverse cultures have honed my adaptability and communication skills. I'm not just fluent in the language of design but also in fostering connections across varied backgrounds. 
      My palette extends beyond pixels and vectors; I immerse myself in 
      <a href="../project/photo"> Digital and Film photography</a>, explore 
      <a href="../project/photo">Interactive Arts</a>, and
      <a href="../project/photo">3D Modeling</a>.
      <br><br>
      <span id= "aboutsub">Accessibility, ethical design, and the power to stimulate social and political dialogue are the keystones of my design philosophy.</span> Values-driven design fuels my creativity, leading me to craft projects that stir curiosity and discourse around societal issues. Whether through a thoughtfully captured photograph, an immersive interactive experience, or a compelling visual narrative, I seek to provoke contemplation and action.
      <br><br>
      My journey isn't just geographical; it's a narrative of evolving perspectives, shaped by immersion in different societies. It's this rich tapestry of experiences that fuels my creativity and passion for designing thought-provoking solutions that address societal challenges. Through design, I aspire to amplify voices, cultivate empathy, and spur meaningful change, transcending boundaries and resonating across diverse communities.
