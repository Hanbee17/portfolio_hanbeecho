  <h4>Tadao Ando: Architect who connects nature and humans</h4>
  <div class="myText">
    <p>Type: A booklet<br /><br />
    This booklet is created to introduce the contemporary Jappanese architect, Ando Tadao, and his architecture.<br /><br />
    Through this booklet on Jappanese architect, Ando Tadao, I wanted viewers to sense how I was attracted to his architecture and his architect.
    Moreover, I tried to pay homage to Ando’s work in the design so that it can be more harmonized with his architectural images.
    For example, the cover resembled one of Ando’s very first houses, Row House, which shows his minimalist design and his love of exposed concrete.
    Moreover, my color scheme was grey, black and white which I tried to emphasize Ando’s use of lights. </p>
