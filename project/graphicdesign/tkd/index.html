        The poster design features an action-packed scene of bread figures competing in Olympic taekwondo. 
        The background is a vibrant stadium filled with cheering spectators, with a spotlight on the center where the bread figures are battling it out. 
        <br><br>
        Each bread figure is uniquely shaped and styled to represent a different taekwondo move, such as a high kick. 
        They are dressed in traditional taekwondo uniforms with a touch of bakery flair, such as flour dusted on their clothes. 
        The typography is bold and dynamic, reflecting the energy of the sport and the excitement of the competition. The tagline "Tough As Whole Grains" emphasizes the playful and whimsical nature of the design. 
        The overall effect is a fun and engaging visual that captures the spirit of the Olympic Games while adding a creative twist with the use of bread figures.
      
        In crafting the brochure, I delved into the rich history of Taekwondo and its evolution within the Olympic Games. It serves as an insightful piece, offering a comprehensive view of the sport's origins and its transformative journey over the years. The brochure provides a deeper understanding of Taekwondo's roots, presenting how it has adapted and grown within the Olympic framework.
        <br><br>
        Moreover, I meticulously detailed the competition format for the Paris Olympics, elucidating the rules and structure of the event. This was aimed at providing audiences with a clear and concise overview, ensuring they grasp the nuances of the competition.
        <br><br>
        To symbolize the ascent towards achievement, I integrated 3D-shaped stairs within the brochure's design. This visual metaphor emphasizes the notion that success parallels the act of climbing stairs—each step representing progress and dedication. This addition serves as a visual cue, underscoring the journey and effort required to reach the pinnacle of success within Taekwondo.
        <br><br>
        In essence, the brochure intertwines historical depth with a clear elucidation of the Paris Olympics' Taekwondo competition format, complemented by a visual representation that echoes the ascent to triumph.
