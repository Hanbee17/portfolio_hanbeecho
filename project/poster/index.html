    <p>Type: Informational Poster<br /><br />
    This is an informational poster that has a visual representation of an object;<br /> a suitcase and my personal story related to it.<br /><br />
    This project is designed to deliver a graphical representation of my suitcase and my personal history with it.
    At the bottom, there’s a timeline of the places I have lived ever since I studied abroad since my age of fifteen years old.
    I always used the suitcase in the poster to pack my things as I moved from South Korea to Thailand, Ireland, Belgium and United States.
    I wanted to engage with the viewer by illustrating this informational poster to communicate a better context and understanding. </p>
