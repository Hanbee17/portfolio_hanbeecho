        At MyGenBio, I served as the Lead Designer responsible for both digital and print design initiatives.<br><br>
       My work involved UI/UX design in Figma, branding and packaging development (including bottle and sachet labels), and marketing collateral such as brochures, social media graphics, and banners.
       <br><br> I collaborated with cross-department teams to ensure visual consistency and timely delivery of assets, often iterating on feedback to refine the company’s design language.
       My contributions supported the launch of multiple campaigns and products, enhancing both user experience and brand visibility.
